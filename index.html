        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How do I cache the map for offline use?</h3>
        <p>Before your flight, open the map in the app, zoom in and out, and scroll over your route to cache the map data. Once cached, the map will work offline while in Airplane Mode.</p>

        <h3>Why isn’t the GPS signal working?</h3>
        <p>GPS signals can be weak inside an aircraft. For best results, sit near a window and allow up to 60 seconds for the signal to lock on.</p>

        <h3>Can I use Flight Mode Map without an internet connection?</h3>
        <p>Yes! The app works entirely offline after caching the map data before takeoff. Make sure to complete this step while connected to the internet.</p>
